/**
 * Composition suite for the optional `reactRouter` block.
 *
 * The risk this guards is a silent one. `reactRouter` is SUBTRACTIVE (it
 * turns `no-empty-pattern` off) and its glob, `**\/routes/**\/*.tsx`, is not
 * unique to React Router. Folding it back into `react` (or widening its
 * scope) would quietly relax the rule for every file-based router that ships
 * a `routes/` directory, and nothing would fail. So this asks ESLint itself
 * what the composed config resolves to, on both sides of the opt-in.
 *
 * `calculateConfigForFile` computes config only; it never parses the file, so
 * the paths below do not need to exist.
